# discord-andewbot
AndewBot for Discord. This is already running on Heroku and is mainly for personal use, and I doubt anyone will find the source code useful. But here it is. Please forgive the spaghetti-ness. **[More info](https://ajlee2006.github.io/discbot/)**

The file also runs [Reacter](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=979695072322940928&permissions=1074070592&scope=bot) to make the most of my Heroku dyno
